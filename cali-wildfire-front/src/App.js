              The way I can explain is that think of this as a train station. You start at "/" or http://localhost:3000
              and if you would like to reach the timeline page you will hop on station "/WildfireTimelineSection" or http://localhost:3000/WildfireTimelineSection.
              Hopefully you are starting to notice that these paths look exactly like URL links because they are so, keep track of names because they also play as 
              import names if you deside to link a page directly to another.  */}
