        NOTE: This README.md will conitnue with ONLY VSCode in mind
        
  *!* Must also have cloned this repository 

  To check if everything is downloaded, in your VSCode run these commands: 
  
      node --version
      npm --version
      
  If they return a version number that means they are both installed. 
      

Next, you will need to instal progect dependencies.

      NOTE: Dependencies might change through the duration of this project

  In the terminal of your VSCode input this command: 
  
      npm intall 

  To check if this was installed, run these commands: 
  
      cd cali-wildfire-front
      npm start

  If you see a tab opening in your browser and a React logo appears vuala it works.
